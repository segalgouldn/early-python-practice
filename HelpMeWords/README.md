You're gonna need [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) if you want it to post to Twitter. 

Using a file containting lots of words, this program uses NLTK to find what look like nouns and verbs. Based on the randomly selected word and its type, it then posts either 'Help me, NOUN' or 'Help me VERB'

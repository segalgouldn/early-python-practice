#corporate.py:
###Tweet like your boss!
[@From_Corporate](https://twitter.com/From_Corporate)
####TODO:
Make it more object-oriented. Make it command-line-friendly. Maybe add more words to the lists? 
####Info:
You're gonna need [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) if you want it to post to Twitter. 
Install with <code>pip install twython</code>.
#corporate_old.py:
###Generate letters like your boss!
This is basically what the current version did before I decided I wanted it to Tweet.
